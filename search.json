    "text": "If you’re using HTTPS, you can use Git’s credential helper to remember your GitHub credentials for each repository. Here’s how to do it:\n\nSet the Git Credential Helper:\n\nOpen Terminal.\nRun git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain to set the Git credential helper to osxkeychain, which tells Git to remember your credentials in MacOS’s keychain.\n\nChange the Remote URL to Include Your Username:\n\nIn your project directory, run git remote set-url origin https://userb@github.com/userb/repo.git, replacing userb with your actual username and userb/repo.git with the actual path to your repository.\nThis tells Git to always use userb when pushing to this repository.\n\nEnter Your Password When Prompted:\n\nThe next time you push, you’ll be asked for your password. Enter the password for userb.\nGit will remember your username and password for this repository, so you won’t have to enter them again.\n\nRepeat the Process for Each Repository:\n\nYou’ll need to repeat this process for each repository, replacing userb with the correct username for each one.\n\n\nNow, Git will remember your credentials for each repository separately. If you’re still having trouble, let me know! I’m here to help."
